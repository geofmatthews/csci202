\item[Due date:] Midnight, Monday, May 1.

\item[Goals:] Taking style out of HTML.

\item[Zip your folder:]
There is only one file this time, so it's not necessary to zip your folder.

\item[Style files:]  You will not create any style files for this
  assignment.  All styling will be done with an internal style sheet
  for each file, marked off with the \verb|<style>| tag.

  This will make it easier for the grader to see both your html and
  your css at once.

\item[Files:]  You will create just one  {\tt .html} file: {\tt lab03.html}.
    It should pass the W3C validator with no errors.

The html for this file is found in the file {\tt lab03nostyle.html} on
the github site.

In that file, all the styling is done the {\em wrong} way, inline with
the html.  You are to reproduce this page replacing the depricated
html with css structures.

In particular, no tables and no font elemetns should be used.
Instead, introduce div tags and css rules.

I don't expect your results to look {\em exactly} like the original,
but it should have things in relatively the right place, with all the
colors, fonts, etc. applied.
