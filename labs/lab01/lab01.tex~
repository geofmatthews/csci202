\item[Due date:] Midnight, Monday, April 17.

\item[Goals:] Get familiar with the basics of HTML.

\item[Zip your folder:]

  Create all your files in a single folder and
  make a compressed (zip) archive of the folder.
  
  On Windows,
  right-click on the folder, select ``Send to'', and then
  ``Compressed (zipped) folder.''
  
  On a Mac, right-click the folder, select ``Compress items''.
  
  On either system, you will then see a newly created file with
  the {\tt .zip} extension.  This is what you want to turn in to
  canvas.
  
\item[Files:]  You will create five {\tt .html} files:
  \begin{description}
  \item[index.html]  This file will have an ordered list of links to
    the other four files.
  \item[page01.html]
